A device to prevent user from going into unwanted sleep. combines input from three sensors(pulse sensor, accelerometer, heart rate sensor)
and determines whether the user is asleep or not.Pulse sensor is the main sleep detection system, it tracks the pulse drop the user has during the day, the accelerometer records movement at the time. The algorithm decides whether the user is sleep or not. Then the vibration motor runs to alert the user. The vibration will turn off with a very strong shake from the user.
